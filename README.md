# SQL-Covid-19-project

In this project, I use SQL to explore covid-19 data. For this purpose, I used skills such as Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views and Converting Data Types. 
In the begining, I find some general insights about total cases, deaths etc and finally I keep some information in temporary tables for visualization.
